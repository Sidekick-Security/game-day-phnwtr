# GameDay

## WHY - Vision & Purpose

### Purpose & Users

The GameDay Platform aims to revolutionize how organizations conduct tabletop exercises by making them more frequent, lightweight, and actionable. The platform addresses the common problem of organizations conducting infrequent, heavy-weight tabletop exercises that may not provide continuous improvement in incident response capabilities.

Target Users:

- Information Security Teams

- IT Operations Teams

- Business Continuity Teams

- Compliance Officers

- Risk Management Teams

Key Differentiators:

- AI-driven scenario generation based on organization-specific context

- Lightweight, frequent exercises (60-90 minutes) vs. annual heavy-weight exercises

- Automated analysis and reporting

- Multi-platform support (web, Slack, Teams)

- Automated scheduling and coordination

## WHAT - Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

System must:

Organization Context Management:

- Allow administrators to input and maintain organizational context including:

  - Industry vertical

  - Key technologies and systems

  - Team structure and roles

  - Business model

  - Company size

  - Compliance requirements

Scenario Generation:

- Generate contextually relevant incident scenarios using AI

- Create realistic injects based on the organization's profile

- Support different types of incidents (security, operational, business continuity)

Exercise Coordination:

- Automatically schedule exercises on configurable intervals (monthly/quarterly)

- Send notifications to participants across multiple platforms

- Coordinate exercise start times with participant calendars

- Create and manage virtual meeting spaces (video/call bridges)

- Present scenario details and injects at appropriate times

Exercise Execution:

- Record all participant actions and communications

- Track timing of responses and decisions

- Support inject delivery based on participant actions

- Allow facilitator override and control

- Enable participant interaction across multiple platforms

Analysis and Reporting:

- Record and analyze exercise outcomes

- Identify gaps in:

  - People (skills, training, availability)

  - Process (procedures, documentation, communication)

  - Technology (tools, systems, integration)

- Map identified gaps to compliance requirements

- Generate specific, actionable recommendations

- Produce detailed exercise reports

- Track improvement over time across multiple exercises
