Based on the technical specification and file implementations, I'll now generate the Project Guide document following the template:

# Project Guide

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The GameDay Platform is an innovative AI-driven tabletop exercise system designed to revolutionize incident response training in organizations. It leverages advanced AI capabilities for scenario generation and automated coordination, enabling Information Security, IT Operations, and Business Continuity teams to conduct regular, lightweight exercises that enhance organizational resilience.

The platform features automated exercise generation, multi-platform delivery through Teams and Slack integration, and data-driven insights. It significantly reduces the resource overhead traditionally associated with tabletop exercises while improving their effectiveness and compliance alignment.
